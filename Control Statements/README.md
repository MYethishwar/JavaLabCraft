In Java, there are generally three types of control statements:

Control statements are programming constructs that dictate the flow of execution within a program. They allow you to make decisions, repeat blocks of code, and alter the normal sequence of program execution. In essence, control statements enable you to control the flow of your program based on various conditions and requirements# Java Control Statements

## Selection Statements/Conditional Statements

Conditional statements are used to make decisions based on certain conditions.

- **if statement**
- **if-else statement**
- **if-else if-else statement** (also known as nested if-else)
- **switch statement**

## Looping Statements (Iteration)

Iteration statements are used to repeatedly execute a block of code.

- **for loop**
- **while loop**
- **do-while loop**

## Jump Statements

Jumping statements are used to alter the normal flow of control.

- **break statement**
- **continue statement**
- **return statement**
- **throw statement**

These control statements provide various ways to control the flow of execution in Java programs.
